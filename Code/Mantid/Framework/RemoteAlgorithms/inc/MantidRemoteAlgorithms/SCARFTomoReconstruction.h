/***
    Algorithm to initiate, query about, or cancel a tomographic
    reconstruction on the SCARF computer cluster at RAL.
    The algorithm can be used to send different commands to the job
    queue, for example: start a reconstruction job, retrieve
    information about a job or to cancel jobs.

    Output Properties: None.
    If the authentication is successfull, a cookie is received that is stored
    internally and re-used for all subsequent interactions with the compute
    resource.
