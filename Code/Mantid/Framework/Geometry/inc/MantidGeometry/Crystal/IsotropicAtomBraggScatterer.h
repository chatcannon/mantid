/** IsotropicAtomBraggScatterer

    IsotropicAtomBraggScatterer calculates the structure factor for
    a given HKL using the following equation, which gives the
    structure factor for the j-th atom in the unit cell:

        F(hkl)_j = b_j * o_j * DWF_j(hkl) * exp[i * 2pi * (h*x_j + k*y_j + l*z_j)]

    Since there are many terms in that equation, further explanation
    is required. The j-th atom in a unit cell occupies a certain position,
    here denoted by the fractional coordinates (x, y, z). With this information,
    an important calculation can be already carried out, calculation of the
    so called "phase". This term is easier seen when the complex part is written
    using trigonometric functions:

        phi = 2pi * (h*x_j + k*y_j + l*z_j)
        exp[i * phi] = cos(phi) + i * sin(phi)

    The magnitude of the complex number is determined first of all by the
    scattering length, b_j (which is element specific and tabulated, in
    Mantid this is in PhysicalConstants::NeutronAtom). It is multiplied
    by the occupancy o_j, which is a number on the interval [0, 1], where 0
    is a bit meaningless, since it means "no atoms on this position" and
    1 represents a fully occupied position in the crystal lattice. This number
    can be used to model statistically distributed defects.

    DWF_j denotes the Debye-Waller-factor, which models the diminishing
    scattering power of atoms that are displaced from their position
    (either due to temperature or other effects). It is defined like this:

        DWF_j(hkl) = exp[-2.0 * pi^2 * U * 1/d(hkl)^2]

    Here, U is given in Angstrom^2 (for a discussion of terms regarding
    atomic displacement parameters, please see [1]), it is often of the
    order 0.05. d(hkl) is alculated using the unit cell. The model used
    in this class is isotropic (hence the class name), which may be insufficient
    depending on the crystal structure, but as a first approximation it is
    often enough.

    This class is designed to handle atoms in a unit cell. When a position is set,
    the internally stored space group is used to generate all positions that are
    symmetrically equivalent. In the structure factor calculation method
    all contributions are summed.

    Easiest is demonstration by example. Copper crystallizes in the space group
    Fm-3m, Cu atoms occupy the position (0,0,0) and, because of the F-centering,
    also 3 additional positions.

        BraggScatterer_sptr cu = BraggScattererFactory::Instance().createScatterer(
                                                            "IsotropicAtomBraggScatterer",
                                                            "Element=Cu; SpaceGroup=F m -3 m")
        cu->setProperty("UnitCell", unitCellToStr(cellCu));

        StructureFactor F = cu->calculateStructureFactor(V3D(1, 1, 1));

    The structure factor F contains contributions from all 4 copper atoms in the cell.
    This is convenient especially for general positions. The general position
    of Fm-3m for example has 192 equivalents.
